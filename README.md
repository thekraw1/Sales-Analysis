# Sales-Analysis

### Project Statement:
AAL is a household name in Australia, known for its clothing business since 2000. It caters to all groups— kids, women, men, and seniors. It has opened branches in many states in Australia, in metropolises and tier-1 and tier-2 cities. 
The business is booming, and the company is in an expansion mode. It wants to get an in-depth understanding of its sales so that it can make investment decisions. The CEO has tasked the Head of Sales and Marketing (S&M) of AAL to:
1)	Determine the states that are generating the highest revenues.
2)	Formulate sales programs for states with lower revenues.
   
Analyze the company’s sales data for the fourth quarter across Australia, and state by state and help the company make data-driven decisions for the coming year.
